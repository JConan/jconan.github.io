## Professional Summary

After completing my last mission as a Production Engineer in May 2024, I decided to dedicate myself fully to web and mobile development. As a Fullstack Developer specialized in Svelte and SvelteKit, I have experimented with several frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue before choosing Svelte for its efficiency and simplicity. My previous background in data integration (Tibco BusinessWorks) and DevOps production support has allowed me to develop a solid ability to tackle complex problems. Today, I apply this expertise to ambitious projects, with particular attention to application performance and quality.
